# dipper-nimble
CMR analysis of dipper dataset in NIMBLE.

In this repository you will find a R script which includes the code to conduct Bayesian capture-recapture models using the famous **dipper dataset** (Gilbert Marzolin) and package **NIMBLE** (de Valpine et al. 2017). This code is founded on the scripts from the wonderful workshop titled **"Bayesian capture-recapture inference with hidden Markov models" (_https://oliviergimenez.github.io/bayesian-cr-workshop/_) taught by O. Gimenez, C. R. Nater, S. Cubaynes, P. de Valpine, M. Quéroué** (which I highly recommend if you are interested in conducting capture-recapture analysis in the Bayesian framework). 

This script contains a great variety of models. This has served me as insightful exercise to know how to specify different models and to check if I was doing it right for my own data analysis. I think most of its content is right but I am currently learning, so there may be errors. Please, don't doubt and contact me if you spot any!
